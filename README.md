My Cybersecurity Professional Statement.
Having been born in the analog age of the 80s and having transitioned into the digital age, I have come to value the importance and need for cybersecurity. Being someone who pays great attention to detail and being highly organized, problem shooting and problem solving come naturally to me.  I have been taught since a very young age, that prevention is better than the cure.  My background in education and experience have enabled me to put this saying to good use in finding creative and proactive ways of providing technological solutions for my clients.
